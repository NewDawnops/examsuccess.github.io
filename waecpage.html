		Do you know that about two million candidates write WAEC every year? Out of those two million, less than 40% pass every year.
		<br>
		<br>
		Let me tell you one truth today,<p style="color: green;"> WAEC IS HARD! </p> Remember, it is different from your school exams where the teachers you know set your questions.
	</p>

	<p>
		<p style="color: red; font-style: italic;">
		Let me tell you the story of a brilliant school boy, Silas. He wrote WAEC two years ago. He was the best student in his school and he even represented his school in different competitions, including The Mathematics Cowbell Competition.
		During his WAEC, some of his classmates paid for Runz but Silas said he won't use Runz. He relied on his pure knowledge, because he always passed his school exams and won competitions.
	</p>
		Silas forgot that WAEC is not set by his school teachers and that WAEC is harder than he thought.
		WAEC is not about reading all textbooks back to back, but about knowing how to write exactly what the examiner wants.
		<br>
		After his WAEC, result came out. To cut the long story short, Silas is yet to gain admission meanwhile majority of his friends that used RUNZ are already in school.
		I know of Otaobori Jasope who is now studying Medicine and Surgery in Unilag. This is a true life story.
		The truth is if you Pass or Fail, Nigeria does not care! WAEC will only be happy to collect your money for registration again next year.
		<p style="font-size: bold" ;> BUT WHY WILL YOU ALLOW NIGERIA AND WAEC TO WASTE YOUR TIME AND PLAY WITH YOUR FUTURE WHEN YOU CAN PASS ONCE BY USING OUR 100% LEGIT RUNZ?</p>
